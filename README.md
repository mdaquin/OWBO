# OWBO - Semantic Network editor

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

OWBO is a very simple editor of semantic network. Those are diagrams where nodes are concepts, and edges are relations between these concepts. By simply cliking in the white space, connecting concepts and draging them arround, OWBO provides a very simple interface to create such diagrams.

A key feature of OWBO is that it is entirely contained in one single HTML file. It can work locally and offline since it has no external dependencies. In addition, this means that saving an OWBO semantic network simply means saving that file (crtl-s in your browser). Once saved, you can simply reload that HTML file and carry on where you left off (the features of the editors are save with the file).

In addition, the semantic network can be exported in the RDF Schema turtle format and be worked on, as an ontology, in editors such as Protégé.
